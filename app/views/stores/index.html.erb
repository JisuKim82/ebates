<h1>How does it work?</h1>
  <p>Ebates is an affiliate company. Retailers will pay affiliates money to send traffic to their websites. Ebates takes that commission and splits it with you.
  </p>
<h2>Example</h2>
  <p>
    Macy's gives Ebates 2% of every sale that gets referred. If Ebates sends a customer that makes $500 worth of purchases at Macy's then Ebates will make $10 on that sale. Ebates than takes that $10 and they split the profit by giving you $5. This results in a 1% cash back rate.
  </p>
